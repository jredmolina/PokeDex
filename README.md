# Pokedex
Web application built using React that uses the PokeAPI to be able to search for Pokemon by name and display their type, height, and weight and allowing filters based on type and weight class

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:
1. Node.js: React applications require Node.js to be installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official Node.js website or use a package manager like Homebrew (for macOS and Linux) or Chocolatey (for Windows)
2. Package Manager: NPM (Node Package Manager) is installed automatically with Node.js. Alternatively, you can use Yarn as your package manager. Both NPM and Yarn allow you to install and manage dependencies for your React app.

## Getting Started
To set up and run the React app, follow these steps:
1. Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning the repository containing the React app source code to your local machine. You can use a Git client or download the source code as a ZIP file and extract it.
2. Install Dependencies: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory. Run the following command to install the required dependencies: npm install
3. Start the Development Server: Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server. In your terminal or command prompt, run the following command: npm start
 
This command will start the development server and open your React app in a web browser. You should see the app running at a local development URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
